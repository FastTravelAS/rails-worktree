# Rails Worktree

Git worktree management for Rails projects with isolated databases and configurations.

## Features

- Create git worktrees with automatic branch creation
- Isolated databases per worktree (separate development and test databases)
- Automatic configuration file copying
- Copy node_modules from main worktree
- Easy cleanup with database dropping and directory removal

## Installation

Add to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
group :development do
  gem "rails-worktree"
end
```

Run `bundle install`. A binstub will be automatically created at `bin/worktree`.

Manual binstub installation (if needed):
```bash
bundle exec rake worktree:install
```

## Usage

### Create a worktree

```bash
bin/worktree feature-branch         # From current branch
bin/worktree feature-branch main    # From specific branch
```

This creates a new worktree with:
- Separate databases: `myapp_feature-branch_development` and `myapp_feature-branch_test`
- Copied configuration files (`.env`, `database.yml`, `Procfile.dev`, credentials)
- Copied `node_modules`
- Migrated and seeded databases

### Close a worktree

```bash
bin/worktree --close feature-branch  # From main repo
bin/worktree --close                 # From within worktree
```

Drops both databases, removes the directory, deletes the branch, and cleans up git references.

## Database Configuration

The gem uses environment variables for database names:

- `DATABASE_NAME_DEVELOPMENT` - Development database name
- `DATABASE_NAME_TEST` - Test database name

Your `config/database.yml` should look like:

```yaml
development:
  <<: *default
  database: <%= ENV.fetch("DATABASE_NAME_DEVELOPMENT", "myapp_development") %>
test:
  <<: *default
  database: <%= ENV.fetch("DATABASE_NAME_TEST", "myapp_test") %>
```

The gem automatically:
1. Sets these variables in the worktree's `.env` file
2. Updates the worktree's `database.yml` to use them
3. Creates both development and test databases with unique names

## Requirements

- Ruby >= 2.6.0
- Rails project with standard structure
- PostgreSQL (or modify for your database)
